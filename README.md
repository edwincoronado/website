# Hello 👋🏻!

My name is Edwin Coronado! I'm a software engineer based in San Diego, CA. In here I write about software/tech that I find cool and interesting and also programming topics/tutorials.

I also co-founded [¡Uyuyuy!](https://uyuyuy.com) (pronounced "ooee-ooee-ooee") - a Mexican-inspired nutritional supplements brand with original flavors and [FNT Life](https://fntlife.com) - a fitness & nutrition coaching company and YouTube channel with over 220k subscribers.
