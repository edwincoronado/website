_**TLDR:** sofware engineer experienced in applications development, integrations, performance testing/engineering, core platform + full stack development, client-facing engineering support and training, mentoring interns + junior engineers_

My first encounter with software and "coding" was back in middle school when I would spend hours changing around my MySpace profile. It was amazing to see how a few lines of HTML and CSS could take the ideas I had in my head and put them on my computer screen. I remember how I would scour around the internet finding different snippets of code to do things like hiding the advertisement banner, footer links, etc...

This era of "web 1.0" really got me into technology but I never even really considered that it could turn into a career for me. It honestly didn't even cross my mind. Fast forward to college; I started by picking up Criminal Justice my freshman year. I was interested in pusruing a career in law enforcement and later on get my J.D. I really enjoyed it, but felt like I was never really pushing myself. Three years into my college career, I decided to add Computer Engineering as my second major. This was definitely one of the hardest things I've ever done. It was incredibly demanding as I was also working full time to support myself. All of this really pushed my limits but proved to be one of the absolute best decisions of my life.

During college I had the opportunity of working at Qualcomm as a Test Technician. This was my first exposure to professional software engineering. At my short 20 years old I was completely mesmerized by this experience. The big labs, hundreds of test devices (aka simulators), big beefy servers, incredibly knowledgeable bosses, etc... all of it really got me excited about a career in this field.

Fast forward a couple of years after... walking around my university's campus I noticed that there was a career fair going on. One of the companies there, Intr√©is, had sign that said something to the effect of "looking for the following majors: computer science, MIS, business..", I thought to myself. Why not go up and talk to them? So I did. They talked to me about ITSM, ITIL, GRC, SaaS, and a bunch of other terms I'd never heard in my life before. I got through the interview process and was hired as an intern. They were a ServiceNow partner in the GRC space and ultimately got acquired by ServiceNow and (luckily) I was brought over as an intern.

I have now been working at ServiceNow for almost 7 years and have had the opportunity to work on different areas of the product. You can see more details about that on my [LinkedIn profile](https://www.linkedin.com/in/edwincoronado).
